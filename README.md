# HoriseonCodeRefactor
This is a refactor code to the Horiseon website in which the index.html and style.css files were changed to make the website more accesible. This was done by making sure the index.hmtl had the correct sementic HTML elements, adding alt attributes for the images that were used, changing the title of the website, and making sure everything worked properly when you clicked on a specific heading. Once that was done the style.css was changed accordingly.
